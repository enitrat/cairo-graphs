# Cairo-graph : A graph library in Cairo

## Summary [WIP]


It's sometimes difficult to find a correct path when lost in the labyrinth of the Egyptian pyramids.
Fortunately, Cairo-graphs is a library that can help you.

This library allows you to build graphs entirely in Cairo (no state persistence) so that you can run algorithms on them. 
You can use it for all sorts of operations : find the shortest path between two vertices, find all paths between two vertices, etc.
